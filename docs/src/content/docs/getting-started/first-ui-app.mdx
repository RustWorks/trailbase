This article is a short introduction to TrailBase and some of its features.
We'll bootstrap a database with coffee data, implement a custom TypeScript HTTP
handler for finding the best matches using vector search, and deploy a simple
production-ready web app all in ~100 lines of code.

This introductory tutorial is part of TrailBase's main code repository, which
can be downloaded to follow along by running:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase.git
$ cd trailbase/examples/coffee-vector-search
```

import GettingTrailBase from "./_getting_trailbase.md";

## Importing Data

Before building the app, let's import some data. Keeping it simple,
we'll use the `sqlite3` CLI[^1] directly to import
`examples/coffee-vector-search/arabica_data_cleaned.csv` with the following SQL
script:

import importScript from "@root/examples/coffee-vector-search/import.sql?raw";

<Code
  code={importScript}
  lang="sql"
  title={"examples/coffee-vector-search/import.sql"}
  mark={[]}
/>

Note that we didn't initialize the vector `embedding`. This is merely because
`sqlite3` doesn't have the necessary extensions built-in.
We'll update the entries later on, adding the embedding as part of our initial
database migrations[^2].

From within the `example/coffee-vector-search` directory, you can execute the script
above and import the coffee data by running:

```bash
$ mkdir -p traildepot/data
$ cat import.sql | sqlite3 traildepot/data/main.db -
```

After importing the data while still in the same directory, we can start the
`trail` server:

```bash
$ trail run
```

Because `trail` starts for the first time the migrations in
`traildepot/migrations` will be applied, which are essentially:

```sql
UPDATE coffee SET embedding = vec_f32(FORMAT("[%f, %f, %f, %f]", Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Sweetness));
```

initializing the previously skipped `coffee.embedding` for all records.


## Custom TypeScript Endpoint

Any time you start `trail run`[^3], JavaScript and TypeScript files under
`traildepot/scripts` will be executed.

<Aside type="note">
  TrailBase will automatically transpile TypeScript to JavaScript which can
  then execute on the underlying V8 engine. You don't need a separate build
  step.
</Aside>

We can use this to register custom HTTP API routes among other things.
Let's have a quick look at `examples/coffee-vector-search/traildepot/scripts/main.ts`,
which defines a `/search` API route we'll later use in our application to
find coffees most closely matching our desired coffee notes:

import handlerCode from "@root/examples/coffee-vector-search/traildepot/scripts/main.ts?raw";

<Code
  code={handlerCode}
  lang="ts"
  title={"examples/coffee-vector-search/traildepot/scripts/main.ts"}
  mark={[]}
/>

While `trail run` is up, we can test the public `/search` endpoint simply by
running:

```bash
$ curl "http://localhost:4000/search?aroma=8&flavor=8&acidity=8&sweetness=8"
[
  ["juan luis alvarado romero",7.92,7.58,7.58,8],
  ["eileen koyanagi",7.5,7.33,7.58,8],
  ...
]
```

That's it, we're done with the server side. This is enough to build a simple
search UI.
With little code and a few commands we've ingested CSV data and built a custom
HTTP endpoint using vector search.
If you're not interested in a UI, the same approach setup could be used to
identify relevant documents for AI applications.

## A simple Web UI

After setting up our database, vector search and APIs, we should probably use
them for good measure. For example, we could build a mobile app, have an LLM
answer coffee prompts, or build a small web UI.
Here we'll do the latter. It's quick and also lets us touch more generally on
bundling and deploying web applications with TrailBase.

Note that this is not a web dev tutorial. The specifics of the UI aren't the
focus. We chose React as a well-known option and kept the implementation to
less than 80 lines of code.
In case you want to build your own, we recommend
[vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) to quickly set up an SPA with your favorite JS
framework, e.g.: `npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react`.

Our provided reference implementation, renders 4 numeric input fields to search
for coffee with a certain aroma, flavor, acidity and sweetness score:

import uiCode from "../../../../../examples/coffee-vector-search/src/App.tsx?raw";

<Code
  code={uiCode}
  lang="ts"
  title={"examples/coffee-vector-search/src/App.tsx"}
  mark={[]}
/>

We can start a dev-server with the UI from above and hot-reload running:

```bash
$ npm install && npm dev
```

## Deployment: Putting Everything Together

Whether you've followed along or skipped to here, we can now put everything
together.
Let's start by compiling our `JSX/TSX` web UI down to pure HTML, JS, and CSS
artifacts the browser can understand:

```bash
$ npm install && npm build
```

The artifacts are written to `./dist` and can be served alongside our database
as well as custom API by running:

```bash
$ trail run --public-dir dist
```

You can now check out your fully self-contained app under
[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) or browse the coffee data and
access logs in the [admin dashboard](http://localhost:4000/_/admin).
The admin credentials are logged to the terminal on first start.

All[^4] we need to serve our application in production is:

- the static `trail` binary,
- the `traildepot` folder containing the data and endpoints,
- the `dist` folder containing our web app.

At the end of the day it's just a bunch of hermetic files without transitively
depending on a pyramid of shared libraries or requiring other services to be up
and running like a separate database server.
This makes it very easy to just copy the files over to your server or bundle
everything in a single container.
`examples/coffee-vector-search/Dockerfile` is an example of how you can both build and
bundle using Docker. In fact,

```
$ docker build -t coffee . && docker run -p 4000:4000 coffee
```

will speed-run this entire tutorial by building and starting the app listening
at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

That's it. We hope this was a fun little intro to some of TrailBase's features.
There's more we haven't touched on: CRUD APIs, auth, admin dash, file uploads,
just to name a few.

    If you don't have `sqlite3` already installed, you can install it using
    `brew install sqlite`, `apt-get install sqlite3`, or
    [download](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) pre-built binaries

[^2]:
    Migrations are versioned SQL scripts that will be executed by the database
    on first encounter to programmatically and consistently evolve your database
    schema and data along with your code.
    For example, when you add a new column you'll likely want all your
    integration tests, development setups, and production deployments to add
    the column so your application logic has a consistent schema to target.

    Unless explicitly disabled.

    To serve HTTPS you'll either need a reverse proxy in front to terminate TLS
    or if you don't require end-to-end encryption (e.g. you're not using auth
    or handling sensitive data) you can fall back to TLS termination via a CDN
    like cloudflare.
